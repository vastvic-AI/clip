We are buidling a QnA system using CLIP Multi-model. 
# Clip with cifar 100 dataset to validate zero shot 
To implement it on colab
The code below performs zero-shot prediction using CLIP. This example takes an image from the CIFAR-100 dataset, and predicts the most likely labels among the 100 textual labels from the dataset.
Use this link to dowload the CIFAR 100 dataset https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html. Then upload CIFAR100 dataset under content folder in colab
or load at runtime
trainset = torchvision.datasets.CIFAR100(root='./data', train=True, download=True, transform=transform)
trainloader = DataLoader(trainset, batch_size=32, shuffle=True)
# similarity

   Text 'deer': 0.1888
   Text 'bird': 0.2125

## Multimodal Question-Answering System
#Overview
This system integrates image and text data to provide context-aware answers to user questions. By leveraging OpenAI's CLIP model, it embeds both image and textual data into the same vector space, ensuring seamless correlation between them. Additionally, the system uses a T5 language model to generate detailed answers by complementing information from both modalities.

# Key features include:

Image understanding: Extract features like color, shape, and type directly from the image.
Document integration: Read supporting textual documents to enhance the context for question answering.
Multimodal fusion: Combines image and text data to provide accurate, context-aware answers.
Dynamic embedding alignment: Places image and text embeddings closer together for better correlation.

# install dependencies
pip install torch torchvision transformers openai-clip pillow scikit-learn

# Requirement
Uplaod image of bike available in folder and upload in /content/bike....png folder

Installation
To set up the system, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

pip install torch torchvision transformers openai-clip pillow scikit-learn

Download Models:

#CLIP: The model will be downloaded automatically when the script runs.
Gpt-4 model will also be downloaded automatically when the script initializes.
Usage
Input Requirements
Image: Provide the path to the image for analysis.
Text Document: Supply the document as a string or list of sentences.
Question: Ask a question about the image, document, or both.
Run the System
The system processes the input image and document, places their embeddings in the same vector space, and uses similarity calculations to provide the best answer. Here's how to run it:

# code
# Import the multimodal system
from multimodal_qna_system import process_image, process_text, find_most_relevant, generate_answer_t5

# Example inputs
image_path = "path_to_image.jpg"
text_document = [
    "This bicycle has a sleek frame and ergonomic grips.",
    "The color of the bicycle is bright red, suitable for mountain biking.",
    "The bicycle's tires are designed for all-terrain use."
]
question = "What is the color of the bicycle, and describe its grips?"

# Process image and text
image_features = process_image(image_path)
text_features = process_text(text_document)

# Combine image and text embeddings
all_features = torch.cat([image_features, text_features], dim=0)
all_candidates = ["Image"] + text_document

# Find the most relevant information
best_match, similarity_score = find_most_relevant(question, all_features, all_candidates)

# Generate a detailed answer
if best_match == "Image":
    image_description = "This is a red bicycle with ergonomic grips designed for comfort."
    answer = generate_answer(question, image_description, " ".join(text_document))
else:
    answer = generate_answer(question, best_match, " ".join(text_document))

print("Answer:", answer)

System Workflow
Embedding Creation:

Images are processed by CLIP's encode_image method to create vector embeddings.
Texts are processed using CLIP's encode_text method for textual embeddings.
Similarity Calculation:

The system calculates cosine similarity between the question embedding and the combined image-text embeddings.
Answer Generation:

If the answer is strongly related to the image, a description of the image is used.
Otherwise, the most relevant text snippet from the document is selected.
Gpt generates a detailed, context-aware answer by combining the selected information.

# Sample Question
question = "What is this object in the image and tell me about its grips?"
